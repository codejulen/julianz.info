# Overview

I built this app to showcase my stuff during the COVID19 lockdown when all I wanted to do was deploy web apps.

# Development

As much as I enjoy bleeding edge tech, I have strong biases towards technologies that I use at work. Here's what you need:

| Tech | Version |
|--|--|
| Yarn | v1.22.22 |
| Node | v23.8.0 |

## Getting Started

Do something like:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
