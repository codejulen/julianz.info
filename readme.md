# Overview

I built this app to showcase my stuff during the COVID19 lockdown when all I wanted to do was deploy web apps. It's a geocities-inspired app, written in Typescript, and deployed with Github Pages.

# Development

As much as I enjoy bleeding edge tech, I have strong biases towards technologies that I use at work. Here's what you need:

| Tech | Version  |
| ---- | -------- |
| Yarn | v1.22.22 |
| Node | v23.8.0  |

## Getting Started

Do something like:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Deploying

Predeploy will build and deploy will push to the gh-pages branch.

```
$ yarn predeploy
$ yarn deploy
```
